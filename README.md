# Better Markers for OBS

Better Markers lets you drop editing markers while recording in OBS, so your footage is easier to cut in Premiere Pro later.

## What You Get

- `Add Marker` button directly in OBS
- Marker templates with:
  - title
  - description
  - color
  - optional editable fields while adding a marker
- Scope support:
  - Global
  - Profile (with profile picker)
  - Scene Collection (with scene collection picker)
- Quick marker hotkeys in OBS
- Automatic sidecar + MP4/MOV metadata embed workflow

## How To Use

1. Open OBS.
2. Go to `Tools -> Better Markers Settings`.
3. Create templates (optionally bind them to a specific Profile or Scene Collection).
4. Assign hotkeys in `Settings -> Hotkeys`.
5. Start recording and add markers with the dock button or hotkeys.

## Languages

The plugin uses the same language as your OBS UI automatically.

Included locales:

- English (`en-US`)
- Spanish (`es-ES`)
- Portuguese - Brazil (`pt-BR`)
- German (`de-DE`)
- French (`fr-FR`)
- Russian (`ru-RU`)
- Japanese (`ja-JP`)
- Korean (`ko-KR`)
- Chinese Simplified (`zh-CN`)
- Chinese Traditional (`zh-TW`)
- Turkish (`tr-TR`)
- Polish (`pl-PL`)

## Important Notes

- Markers can be added only while recording is active (not paused).
- If direct embed fails, marker data is kept safely and retried.
